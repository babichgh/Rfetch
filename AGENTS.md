# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working on this repository.

## What this is

`rfetch` is a fastfetch clone in Rust. It prints system information in a column
next to an ASCII logo for the running distribution. It is a binary crate with no
library target, so everything lives in `src/`.

## Commands

```sh
cargo test                              # unit + integration tests
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt
cargo build --release

python3 tools/generate_logos.py --check # is the generated logo table current?
```

The release profile has `panic = "abort"`, so `cargo test` uses the `test`
profile (inherited from dev) and is unaffected.

## Branch and release model

- `dev` is where work happens.
- `main` is the release branch. Pushing to it runs CI and publishes a GitHub
  release tagged `v<version>`, where `<version>` comes from `Cargo.toml`.
- Merging to `main` without bumping the version re-publishes the existing tag
  with replaced assets rather than failing.

To cut a release: bump `version` in `Cargo.toml` on `dev`, merge to `main`.

## Architecture

```
src/
├── main.rs      orchestration; --pipe and --json bypass the layout
├── cli.rs       clap args
├── fetch/       data collection, one module per fact
├── logo/        531 vendored artworks + marker parsing
└── render/      two-column layout, colours, ANSI-aware width
```

`fetch::Context::collect(&modules)` refreshes only what was requested. Reading
`gpu` shells out to `nvidia-smi`; reading `cpu` sleeps 200 ms waiting for a load
delta. A run that skips those modules is effectively instant, so do not make
collection unconditional.

Modules return `Option`. Data that is unavailable makes the line disappear
rather than print `unknown`.

## Things that will bite you

**sysinfo 0.39 API.** `System::uptime()`, `System::host_name()`,
`System::kernel_version()`, `System::name()` and `System::physical_core_count()`
are *associated functions*, not methods. `Disks` is a separate type from
`System`; use `Disks::new_with_refreshed_list()`, which loads both the list and
the counters. Check the vendored source rather than guessing:
`~/.cargo/registry/src/*/sysinfo-0.39.6/`.

**`System::name()` is not the kernel name on Linux.** sysinfo resolves it from
`os-release`, so it returns the distribution name ("Fedora Linux"). `fetch/kernel.rs`
uses a `cfg(target_os)` literal instead.

**ANSI escapes break width maths.** `render::width::visible_len` strips CSI and
OSC sequences. Use it for any padding or column alignment; never `.len()`.

**Logo colour markers are not numbers.** In the vendored art, `$` takes exactly
one following character, per fastfetch's `ffLogoPrintChars`. `$2888` is palette
entry 2 followed by the literal text `888`; `$$` is a literal dollar; the active
colour carries over to the next line. The obvious "read all the digits"
implementation breaks 37 logos. Do not "simplify" `logo::render_art`.

**Do not hand-draw logos.** They were tried and read as random glyphs. All 531
come from fastfetch under `logos/`, copied verbatim.

## Regenerating the logo table

`logos/*.txt` is art; `logos/meta.json` is names and palettes extracted from
fastfetch's C headers. Both feed `src/logo/generated.rs`, which is committed.

```sh
python3 tools/generate_logos.py               # regenerate generated.rs
python3 tools/generate_logos.py --check       # fail if stale
python3 tools/generate_logos.py --sync PATH   # refresh meta.json from a
                                               # fastfetch checkout
```

`--sync` is the only mode that needs a fastfetch clone; plain runs and `--check`
work from `meta.json`, which is why CI can verify the table.

The generator runs its output through `rustfmt`. Without that it fights
`cargo fmt` and `--check` reports the file as stale immediately.

Art is marked `-text -diff` in `.gitattributes`. Do not let an editor or EOL
conversion rewrite it.

## Packaging

`packaging/rfetch.spec` builds the rpm; `packaging/build-deb.sh` builds the deb
from `packaging/debian/control.in`.

- `%cargo_build` is deliberately not used: it shells out to `fg` and fails in a
  non-interactive build shell.
- `--locked`, never `--offline`. A clean buildroot has no registry cache, so
  `--offline` cannot work.
- The deb is compiled inside `rust:1-bookworm`, not on the Ubuntu runner, so the
  binary does not need a newer glibc than the machines it targets.
- Only the binary rpm is published; Fedora auto-generates debuginfo and
  debugsource packages that roughly double the download.

## Testing

`tests/cli.rs` runs the compiled binary. One test renders **all 531 logos**, so
a change that breaks any single artwork is caught. That test is also the slow
one; the rpm spec's `%check` runs `--bins` only to skip it.

## Known issues

- `main` currently has no branch protection; `dev` merges are not enforced.
